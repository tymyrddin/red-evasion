# Next-Generation security

## IDPS

The primary functions of IDPS solutions can be broken down into four main categories:

* Monitoring: IDPS monitors IT systems using either signature-based or anomaly-based intrusion detection to identify 
abnormal behavior and signature malicious activity.
* Alerts: After identifying potential threats, IDPS software will log and send out alert notifications to inform 
administrators of abnormal activity.
* Remediation: IDPS tools provide blocking mechanisms for malicious threats, giving administrators time to take 
action. In some cases, IT teams may not need to take action after an attack is blocked.
* Maintenance: Besides monitoring for abnormal behavior, IDPS tools can also monitor the performance of IT hardware 
and security components with health checks. This health monitoring ensures a security infrastructure is operating 
correctly at all times.

## NGNIPS

Next-Generation Network IPS (NGNIPS) have the following five characteristics according to Gartner (in 2013):

* Standard first-generation IPS capabilities: A next-generation network IPS can do what a traditional network IPS can do.
* Application awareness and full-stack visibility: Identify traffic from various applications and enforce network 
security policies. An NGNIPS must be able to understand up to the application layer.
* Context awareness: Use information from sources outside the IPS to aid in blocking decisions.
* Content awareness: Able to inspect and classify files, such as executable programs and documents, in inbound and 
outbound traffic.
* Agile engine: Support upgrade paths to benefit from new information feeds.

NGIPS and NGFW are not the same and having both can be very useful.

## Next-Generation people

The digital age has brought with it the ubiquity of data. This omnipresent data, of all kinds, has necessitated the 
spread of organisational roles that manage, organize and safeguard this data.
