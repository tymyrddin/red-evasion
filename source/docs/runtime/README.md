## What?

Bypass common runtime detection measures, such as AMSI, using modern tool-agnostic approaches.

## Why?

Overcoming headaches and roadblocks when executing malicious code.

## How?

* [Study AMSI](amsi.md)
* [PowerShell downgrade](downgrade.md)
* [PowerShell reflection](reflection.md)
* [Patching AMSI](patching.md)
* [Automating, but ...](automation.md)
